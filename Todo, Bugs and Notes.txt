BUGS


ISSUES

ONE
The dig system doesnt allow for the placement of a dig spot directly underneath 
the player.

TWO
The doors are already drawn on the map but I need to activate the trigger twice 
to get rid of the door and get it working correctly. This applies to both doors.


TODO

ONE
Find a way to make an object appear on the map without having to move first.


IDEAS

ONE 
Implement an event system

TWO
For a dialogue system i can use a map to store dialogue and use dialogue ID's to fetch them

THREE
Add a direction system so the player can turn, make the system show which direction the player is facing at all times
