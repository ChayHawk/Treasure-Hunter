BUGS

ONE
The dig system allows the player to dig through collision tiles, which is not
Ideal in most cases

TWO
The current system of redrawing the map tiles when the player moves works, however
When the player spawns, a player character is spawned on the map independant
of the actual player character.


ISSUES

ONE
The dig system doesnt allow for the placement of a dig spot directly underneath 
the player

TWO
The doors are already drawn on the map but I need to activate the trigger twice 
to get rid of the door and get it working correctly. This applies to both doors.


TODO

ONE
Re-order ModifyTile method to make least important stuff last
