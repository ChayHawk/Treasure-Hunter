IDEAS

ONE 
Implement an event system

TWO
For a dialogue system i can use a map to store dialogue and use dialogue ID's to fetch them

THREE
Add a direction system so the player can turn, make the system show which direction the player is facing at all times



NOTES

ONE

I initially had an issue where my player was drawing directly onto the map, which meant that when I dug a 
hole (by changing a tile to a blank space), the player's sprite would overwrite that change when moving over it. 
Essentially, every time I used ModifyTile to place the player's character, it was updating the underlying base tile. 
That caused holes or any other persistent changes to be lost or shifted because the player's sprite replaced the 
modified tile data. To fix this, I separated the drawing of dynamic entities (like the player) from the static 
map data by introducing an extra layer—the entity layer. I added an entityTile member to my Tile class, which 
I use exclusively for overlaying objects like the player. In my draw function, I now check if a tile has an entity; 
if it does, I display that entity instead of the base tile. This way, the base tile remains unchanged, so any holes I 
dig remain permanently blank, even when the player moves over them. This separation not only preserves the integrity 
of my persistent map changes but also makes it easier to add more dynamic objects later without interfering with the 
base map data.
